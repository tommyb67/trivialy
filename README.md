WDI Sept Array first Project - trivialy a commuter trivia rails application

Hello, this is my first project for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

It's a trivia game that eventually will be marketed to commuters.  For now it just asks 5 randowm questions and gives you a random score between 5 and 50.  At the end of the game you will see the answers to the questions you were asked and be added to the high score table (maybe!)

I used nested resources. it's set up as users - games - questions.  This may be a bit more complicated then it needs to be, but I am happy with it for now.
